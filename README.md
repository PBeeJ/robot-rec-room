# Robot Rec Room
A React Native based Raspberry Pi Tank controller

## Getting started

### Setup
Follow the **React Native CLI Quickstart** instructions at https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.

- If you want to build on an Android, you have to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to manage the SDKs.
- If you want to build on an IOS Device, you have to install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

### Running on an Android
* Enable debugging mode on your device
* Connect your phone via a USB cable
* `git clone https://github.com/PBeeJ/robot-rec-room.git`
* `cd robot-rec-room`
* `yarn install` (when is this not necessary?)
* Edit `.env` to set the IP address of the robot to be controlled.  Maybe you need to edit the files to get the changes picked up (ref: https://github.com/zetachang/react-native-dotenv/issues/20) 
* `yarn android`

### Running on an IOS device
